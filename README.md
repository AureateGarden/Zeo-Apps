# Zeo-Apps Bucket

This is a [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) bucket for my own applications.

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add Zeo-Apps https://github.com/AureateGarden/Zeo-Apps.git
scoop install Zeo-Apps/<manifestname>
```

## How do I contribute new manifests?

To make a new manifest contribution, please read the [Contributing
Guide](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [App Manifests](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/App-Manifests)
wiki page.
